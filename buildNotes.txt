//Material UI
    is 
        ng package 
            with ng components

                such as 
                navigation 
                layout
                form controls

    
    be sure to
        unlock the component in 'app module'
        and in the appropriate people or projects module
        prior to use 


//SCSS notes 
    app.component.SCSS  
        has 
            main
    
    app.people.component.SCSS 
        has 
            nada for now
    
    app.people-list.component.SCSS

//Structural Directives 
    dynamically loop to create x panels or what ever 
    instructions on element
    example 
        ngModel 
            applies to a single element

        *ngfor 
            structually change the rendered html code 
            helper tool to repeat element as often as required 

//Creating people list with property and event binding 
    first
    in the template
        build up the input field 
            using
            mat input 

            add mgModel for two way binding 
        
    in the component.ts file 
        use two-way binding 
            by adding a property to the 
            class
    
    second
    in the component.ts 
        add a const
        example 
            const people ={name: this.enteredName, role: this.enteredRole};

            where 
                enteredName
                and
                enteredRole
                    are properties on the class
    
    third 
        get the data from the form to another component

            can emit events 
            and 
            send data into a component
            add it to say an array 
            then later 
            send it to a component

//Model creation
    file 
        people.model added 
            using interface which is like a class and defines how an object can be instanciated
            so 
                Person[]
            and 
            exported

        imported   
            Person[]
                to 
                    app.component   
                    people-list.component
                    people-add.component 
                    
//Adding NodeJS 

    RESTful API 
        a server side app or service 

        is
        stateless backend 
        
        does 
        exposes a few URLs or paths 

            for instance 
                RESTFul Server API
                /users
                /projects
                /people 

                    has 
                        get
                        post 
                        get
                        delete 

                     can 
                        req (AJAX) from 
                            the Angualar client 
                        
                        res from API 
                            to use in client side 

                    JSON
                        is how we communicate 
                            from server to 
                                client 

        this sets things up to allow for servicing multiple clients
            like
            mobile 
            client code 


    starting server 
        in terminal
